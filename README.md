# Capstone Project
## Pedestrian Group Detection 

# Abstract
The edge-computing, a distributed computing system that processes complex computation and data storage closer to the location, is a growing innovation technique in artificial intelligence and IoT (Internet of Things). Using the YOLO on NVIDIA Jetson-Nano, pedestrians in the Washington, DC area are detected, and the algorithm for pedestrian feature detection developed based on OpenCV and YOLO. (YOLOv3 detection is widely used, but tracking group units such as family, friends, or couples still remains challenging tasks.) These analyses will enable city developers to find out business potentials and bring insights into the communities. In the research, the algorithm based on YOLOv4 will detect the existing real-time pedestrian and family units by measuring distance between the detected objects.
